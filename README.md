# WebAssessment

What did you like about this project?
-- It is a good practice of simulating web design with given UI/UX.


What did you struggle with in this project?
-- Struggle with dimension which is not given.
-- For 60% 40% dimensions, if we follow specs we need to add additional 24px+24px which will result in total width exceed 100%.
-- Also for Mobile view the max-width is 720px, which is much different than the spec picture (spec pic looks like the width is only 480px)


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
-- to be more familiar with coding, need to practice more and shorten the coding timeline.
